Image Gallery Project
This is a React-based image gallery project with several features aimed at providing a user-friendly experience for managing and interacting with images.

Features
Drag and Drop Reordering: Utilizes the react-flip-move library to enable drag and drop reordering of images within the gallery.

Responsive Header: The header of the gallery adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

Multiple Image Selection: Users can select multiple images with visual clarity, making it easy to identify which images are currently selected.

Integration of React Icons: React icons are utilized for various buttons within the gallery, enhancing the visual appeal and providing recognizable icons for different actions.

Page Background Color Transition: The page background features a smooth color transition effect, adding a subtle visual enhancement to the overall user interface.

Revert Option After Deletion: Users have the option to revert the deletion of images, providing a safety net in case they accidentally delete images they didn't intend to.

Add Image Functionality Omitted: Although the ability to add new images was not a requirement, the gallery is designed to accommodate future integration of this feature.

Bulk Image Deletion: Users can delete multiple images at once, streamlining the process of managing large galleries.
